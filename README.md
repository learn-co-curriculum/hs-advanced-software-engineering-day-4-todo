Today we'll be adding a User model into our applications! For this morning's ToDo: 

1. Get your database configured with your Social Media and Fwitter projects. 

2. Check out the OO Whale Lab. This lab is test driven - run `learn` and make the tests pass. It will have you create two different classes, a `Whale` class and a `Calf` class, and create a relationship between them. While you're doing the lab, think about how the relationship between a whale and a calf is similar to the relationship between a user and a tweet.
